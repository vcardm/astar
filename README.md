# ASTAR

Program that implements the A* algorithm to find a path from any two given nodes.

Steps: 
1. Create a fully-observable environment where there are both pathable and blocked nodes (15 x 15)
2. Get input from the user and an agent must find a good path from their starting node to the goal node
3. The agent must use the A* algorithm to determine its path - Used the Manhattan method for calculating the heuristic
4. Output the envrionment with blocked nodes and path from the start to goal node
