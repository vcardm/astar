# ASTAR

Program that implements the A* algorithm to find a path from any two given nodes.

Create a fully-observable environment where there are both pathable and blocked nodes, an agent must find a good path 
from their starting node to the goal node. The agent must use the A* algorithm to determine its path. Used the Manhattan method for calculating the heuristic.
